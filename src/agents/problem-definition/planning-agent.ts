// Based on the issue, define details via prompts:
// - What is the problem?
// - Which code needs to be changed?
// - If this is a new code file, where should it be located
// - Get a tree view of the code-base and use in prompts (tree view command or source path should be configurable)
// - Where do we store the tests
// - Get the command to create the file
// - Get the command to create the test file
// - Report back progress to the issue

// Where do we store state? A file that is never committed?
// How do we steer the model for awareness of the codebase and perhaps knowledge from PRs etc?
